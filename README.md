# WRyan's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find information about me, my skills, and projects I have developed.

## About Me

Hello, my name is **Wesley Ryan** and I am a **Front-End Web Developer**. Since starting my journey in web development, I have been dedicated to creating and improving websites, always keeping up with new trends and technologies. My goal is to create efficient, responsive, accessible, and visually appealing sites.

I am fascinated by technology and programming. When I was younger, I took my first steps in programming using **VBA** to automate **Excel** spreadsheets. I am currently studying **Systems Analysis and Development** and plan to pursue a master's in **Software Engineering**.

I have a keen interest in **robotics** and **artificial intelligence**, and in 2018 I enrolled at UFPel in the **Mechatronics Engineering** program. I am also passionate about cars and music; I play several instruments, including guitar, drums, and flute.
